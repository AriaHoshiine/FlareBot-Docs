# Help support FlareBot
We love providing our users with high-quality music and configurable administration tools to make sure that they can run their server just how they like! We have continued to grow at insane rates throughout our existance and that couldn't be more true as of late. This means that sadly we need good servers in order to keep the high quality that we like to provide. We have over 30k servers with FlareBot, over 100k commands ran each day, 200+ concurrent active voice channels and 800+ concurrent connected voice channels!

The amount of server power required to maintain FlareBot's standard of quality is not cheap. You can support the development and free hosting of FlareBot plus enjoy some cool features too!

### Beta
Beta is just like any other beta you may find, we allow guilds to have access to certain commands and features early so they can find bugs and give feedback. Beta is a great way for us to change the commands to better suit the users so when we do release to the public we don't have to be taking a bunch of suggestions. Beta is a very nice privilege but can come at the cost of bugs, reporting these though will usually get them fixed for the next day. We hope you can help us make Flare better by testing cool new features and commands (Which we may never even fully release)!

Thank you for all your amazing support!
